Taking inspiration from both **Astro SSG** and the **View Transition API**, my aim with vite-plugin-ssr and React is to gain greater control over scenarios involving shared UI animations between pages. This includes managing factors such as animation duration and easing while gracefully handling loading states during server fetches. This way, we can ensure that slow networks or large data fetches between pages don't compromise the overall animation experience.

Also using vite-plugin-ssr we have cool features like:
**File based routing**, **SSR + SPA**, **Page Transitions functions**, **Layouts**, **Pre-rendering**,

As the name suggest wanted to add some small feature such as
**Markdown content collection**, **Syntax Highlighter**, **Copy Code Blocks**, **generative Table of content and headings**
